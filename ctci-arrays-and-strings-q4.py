# Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palin-
# drome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation
# is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
# EXAMPLE
# Input:T a c t Coa
# Output:True (permutations:
# Hints: #106,
# 1.5
# "taco cat", "atco eta",
# etc.)
# h 0134, ยง 136
